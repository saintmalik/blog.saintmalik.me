A lot of uncertainty this year fr fr. Like, A LOT lot. But we move.

Tried many things i feared trying in the last two years

NYSC Service? Was it fun? Meh. Was it draining? Hell yeah. Was it fair? I guess.

Most hilarious month? October, had a tight run

And to everyone who has helped me one way or the other, thank you all 🙏

In all? Alhamdullilah

Scary Hours? Just Shukran 😊

Lol, at least we tried 🤷🏽‍♂️!, next year we go again, pray our lives gets spared and preserved over the coming years ✌🏽✌🏽

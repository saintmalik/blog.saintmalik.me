You probably handling your manifest and deployment secrets in kube like this

<!--truncate-->

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  name: hashicorp-vault-k8s
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: busybox
        name:
        env:
        - name: API_KEY
          value: jduhdshieioieiisbbjsb
        - name: AWS_KEY
          value: 96859988gddjjdjds
        - name: WEBHOOK_SECRET
          value: jimjimjimokaynice
```

you are adding the secrets using environment variables, and if you are not doing it this way, you probably mounting it as a file path or injecting it as a file.

regardless of the ways you are getting secrets to your pods, none of the process is recommended security wise, because secrets are not encrypted on rest, in memory or etcd.

injected secrets in the containers are in plaintext or base64, and you might also end up committing the yaml file to github as your Source Of Truth that if you plan to do GitOps.

and if something goes wrong either at org level or via third party access on your github repo, these secrets become available to attackers in plaintext.

So lets get into fixing this, time to jump in;

## My Environment set up?

- AWS EKS Cluster(Fargate) â€” Here is terraform codes
- Local Installations are helm, kubectl and Vault for CLI

## What will i be doing ?
- Spun up a running Vault on Kubernetes
- Kubernetes Auth Method
- Create and use Vault KV secrets engine
- Vault Policies and Service Accounts creations
- Injection of created secrets in kv into our deployment/pod yaml file

## Vault Installation

Before installing the vault, you need to create a namespace called vault in your kube cluster

```yaml
kubectl create ns vault
```
after that, you can install vault using helm install, installing it this way means you are following the default configurations and there is requirement for a PVC in other to create a "file" backend as data storage for vault.

```yaml
helm install vault hashicorp/vault --namespace vault
```

Although this process is not recommend in production, due to absent of High Availailty, you might consider Consul as your backend for data storage in prod.

Done with the installation, noticed the vault-0 pods is yet to be ready, thats because the vault hasnt been unsealed, so lets get it up

  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-installed.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault installed"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-installed.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault installed"/>
</picture>

### Initialize and unseal vault

so run
```yaml
kubectl exec -it vault-vault-0  -n vault -- vault operator init
```
<picture>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-operator-init.jpg`} alt="hashicorp-vault-operator-init"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-operator-init.jpg`} alt="hashicorp-vault-operator-init"/>
</picture>

Now you need to unseal atleast 3 key to get it up running

```yaml
kubectl exec -it vault-vault-0  -n vault -- vault operator unseal KEY1
kubectl exec -it vault-vault-0  -n vault -- vault operator unseal KEY2
kubectl exec -it vault-vault-0  -n vault -- vault operator unseal KEY3
```
:::note
Also make sure you copy both the root token and the sealed keys into seperate note cause you might need to login via root token later or probably unsealling again.

because if you cant unseal your vault, it means you've lost access to your vault and the data, hence you will be creating a new vault

  <p>unsealed one key</p>

  <p>unsealed three keys</p>
  </Figure>

Also there are ways to auto unseal, but thats a topic for another day.

Done initializing and unsealing? now login into your vault using the root token you copied earlier

```yaml
kubectl exec -it vault-vault-0  -n vault -- vault login
```

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-login-sucess.webp`} alt="hashicorp vault login success"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-login-sucess.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault login success"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicorp-vault-login-sucess.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault login success"/>
</picture>

## Kubernetes Auth Method

This stage is where you configure authentication between the kube cluster and vault server, so enable auth for kubernetes by running this

```yaml
vault auth enable kubernetes
```
now write the configurration into the config path of the auth engine you just created

```yaml
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
token_reviewer_jwt="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" \
kubernetes_host=https://${KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR}:443 \
kubernetes_ca_cert=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt \
issuer="https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"
```

In addition to this, you can configure all this on the UI side too by running

```yaml
kubectl port-forward svc/vault-vault -n vault 443:8200
```

## Create and use Vault KV secrets engine

vault kv secrets engine is used to store static secrets, writing a key/value pairs to the vault which should be a non-string values

so enable the kv secrets engine by running this in your vault

```yaml
vault secrets enable -path=secret/ kv-v2

OR

vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=secret/ kv
```

So now that you have enabled the kv secret engine, lets start creating secrets in different file paths

```yaml
vault kv put -mount=secret golangsecrets apikey="jduhdshieioieiisbbjsb" awskey="96859988gddjjdjds"  webhooksecret="jimjimjimokaynice"
```

<picture>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/kube-vault-create-kv-secret.jpg`} alt="kube-vault-create-kv-secret"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/kube-vault-create-kv-secret.jpg`} alt="kube-vault-create-kv-secret"/>
</picture>

So now you've created kube auth, you can also enable kv secrets at the same time.

I have added our secret to golangsecrets file, it is acessible on the path **secret/data/golangsecrets**.

Now let's move to the part where you can make vault and pods to  communicate with each other via roles, service account and policies.

## Create custom service account

While the humans use kubeconfig to authenticate with the cluster, pods use serviceaccounts to authenticate.

And i believe you know your pods has a default service account, but this default service accounts does not have any permission, so its not useful.

Now you need to create a custom service account for your pod which will be binded to the vault authentication roles you will be creating alongside the vault policies that carries the permission that the role can access.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
    name: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod
    labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod
```

## Creating vault policies

You need to create a policies that defines what access a vault role has on a certain secret path, whether its just a **read** permission or the role can perform more actions such as **delete**, **update** and more, you can also read up more about vault policies <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies" target="_blank">here</a>.

But in this guide i only needa read access so i will be creating the hcl file that holds the rules

```yaml
cat <<EOF> /home/vault/hashicorp-vault-k8s.hcl
path "/secret/data/golangsecrets" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
  }
EOF
```

now you create the policy by running

```yaml
vault policy write hashi-vault-k8s-policy /home/vault/hashicorp-vault-k8s.hcl
```

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/vault-policy-creation.webp`} alt="vault policy creation"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/vault-policy-creation.jpg`} alt="vault policy creation"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/vault-policy-creation.jpg`} alt="vault policy creation"/>
</picture>

## Creating vault roles for k8s access

You need to create a vault role under the k8s auth you've configured earlier, this role is what you will bind the serviceaccount and policies too.

```yaml
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/hashi-vault-k8s-role \
    bound_service_account_names=hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=vault \
    policies=demo-hashi-vault-k8s-policy \
    ttl=24h
```
So now that you've created the role and you've also binded the serviceaccount and policy you created earlier.

It's time to move to the next part, injecting secret into our pods.

But before that, i would like to inform you that you can use a single role and bind more than just one service account to it, likewise the namespaces too.

## Injection of created secrets in kv into our deployment/pod yaml file

With the serviceaccount you created earlier, it's time to use it in your pods now by adding it to your deployment yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  name: hashicorp-vault-k8s
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod //add the serviceacccount to your pods
      containers:
      - image: busybox
        name: hashicorp-vault-container
        command:
          ['sh', '-c']
        args:
          ['source /vault/secrets/golangsecrets']

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
    name: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod
    labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod

```

Now you need to inject the vault agent injector by addding the followwing annotation to your yaml file

```yaml
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: 'true'
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-golangsecrets: secret/golangsecrets //my secret file path
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-golangsecrets: |
          {{ with secret "secret/data/golangsecrets -}}
            export API_KEY="{{ .Data.data.apikey }}"
            export AWS_KEY="{{ .Data.data.awskey }}"
            export WEBHOOK_SECRET="{{ .Data.data.webhooksecret }}"
          {{- end }}
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: hashi-vault-k8s-role //the vault role you created earlier
        vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify: 'true'
```

the reason i am also injecting it as template **vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template** is because i want to export it and use it as an enviroment variables

also the **vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify: 'true'** is not recommended in prod, decided to skip it since i didnt set any tls cert for an end to end communication yet.

your final deployment yaml file should look like this

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  name: hashicorp-vault-k8s
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: 'true'
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-golangsecrets: secret/golangsecrets //my secret file path
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-golangsecrets: |
          {{ with secret "secret/data/golangsecrets -}}
            export API_KEY="{{ .Data.data.apikey }}"
            export AWS_KEY="{{ .Data.data.awskey }}"
            export WEBHOOK_SECRET="{{ .Data.data.webhooksecret }}"
          {{- end }}
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: hashi-vault-k8s-role //the vault role you created earlier
        vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify: 'true'
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod //add the serviceacccount to your pods
      containers:
      - image: busybox
        name: hashicorp-vault-container
        command:
          ['sh', '-c']
        args:
          ['source /vault/secrets/golangsecrets']

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
    name: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod
    labels:
        app: hashicorp-vault-k8s-pod

```

So after applying the yaml file using **kubectl apply =f deployu.yaml**, you can confirm if the secrets are successful mounted by navigating into /vault/secrets/ in your pods.

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicopr-vault-deply.webp`} alt="hashicorp vault deployment"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicopr-vault-deply.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault deployment"/>
  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/hashicopr-vault-deply.jpg`} alt="hashicorp vault deployment"/>
</picture>

But in situations where you pods refuse to start, most of the time its caused by an error with the vault agen injector, you can debug it using **kubectl exec -it podsname -n vault -- sh -c vault-agent-init**

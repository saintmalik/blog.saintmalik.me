Just like everyone, i wrote my first dockerfile without having in mind any best practices or security implementations .

<!--truncate-->

The first dockerfile i wrote was for an open source project and i just wanted to dockerize the tool and see it work then.

what changed now and what would i have considered then to make sure i am not just trying to dockerize my apps but also putting in mind the follow the security recommendations.

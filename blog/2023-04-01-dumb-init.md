when it comes to containerized environment graceful shutdown, process management and reducing attack surface, I believe we can't leave **dumb-init** and **tini** out of it.

## What is Dumb-init

Dumb-init, is a tool developed by <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init" target="_blank">Yelp</a> which is a simple and non-heavy process management tool with less footprint, so that way we don't end up exposing our applications to more issues through the tooling security vulnerabilities.

dumb-init can also be described as a tool that serves as a parent process to another process in your docker or containers.

## What is Tini

Tini, created by <a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini" target="_blank">krallin</a>, is another minimal init system specifically designed for containers. It's been increasingly adopted in container ecosystems, including being the default init system in Docker and other container runtimes.

## Why use dumb-init or tini with your docker or containers

1. Signal Forwarding

when you have the following **CMD ["npm start"]** in your Dockerfile, then if the **npm start** runs in your container, it will take the process **PID 1** which is an init process, the first process that runs at the boot time of any Unix system.

```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 node      0:00 npm start
    6 node      0:01 node /app/node_modules/.bin/ts-node-dev --poll src/index.ts
   17 node      4:09 sh
   24 node      0:58 ps
```

Knowing that Node.js is not designed to run as **PID 1**, so running it as **PID 1** would make it give some unexpected behaviors such as the app not responding to the **SIGTERM** and other signals.

or if you have the following **ENTRYPOINT ["source -c env && ./app.sh"]** in your docker file, then ```source -c env && ./app.sh``` will become **PID 1** and then the started application itself becomes a subprocess and

```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 node      0:00 source -c env && ./app.sh
    6 node      0:01 app.sh -- Listening on PORT 9000
```

since the app itself is the one configured to handle **SIGINT** and **SIGTERM**, the shell script won't be able to pass those signals to the app.

2. Reduced attack surface

Since the container process is wrapped around dumb-init and other processes are now child of the dumb-init process which is now **PID 1** process, this shields your app process against responsibilities that comes with **PID 1**

for example, if you want to make sure your app process doesn't assume new privileges in the container, you can simply set ***prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)*** or use ***securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation=false***, but this Linux kernel feature doesn't work with **PID 1** process, instead, it works with the child processes.

So letting your main app process assume **PID 1** in the container they are running can be risky.

## Using Dumb-Init with your Dockerfile

You will have to install dumb-init in the Dockerfile, also it's advisable to call this before other command layers.

now you can do this in two ways, using **ENTRYPOINT**, **CMD** or yaml file if you are working with Kubernetes.

with **ENTRYPOINT**, you can call the dumb-init to be the **PID 1**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init","npm start"]
```

with **ENTRYPOINT** and **CMD**, you can call the dumb-init to be the **PID 1**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["npm start"]
```

but in a situation where you are experiencing issues getting dumb-init in your docker images, there are other ways to get on depending on the system.

### generalized containers with dumb-init binary

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
RUN  wget -O /usr/bin/dumb-init https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init/releases/download/v1.2.5/dumb-init_1.2.5_x86_64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["npm start"]
```

### Ubuntu

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN  apt install -y dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
```

### Alphine

```Dockerfile
FROM alphine:latest
RUN  apk add dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
```

### Python

```Dockerfile
FROM python:latest
RUN  pip3 install dumb-init
....
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
```

### Using dumb-init with Kubernetes yaml file

```yaml
      containers:
      - image: ourdockerfile:latest-dumb-init-installed
        name: container-name
        command:
          ['dumb-init', 'sh', '-c']
        args:
          ['npm start']
```


## Using Tini with your Dockerfile

You will have to install Tini in the Dockerfile, also it's advisable to call this before other command layers.

now you can do this in two ways, using **ENTRYPOINT**, **CMD** or yaml file if you are working with Kubernetes.

with **ENTRYPOINT**, you can call the dumb-init to be the **PID 1**

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20.2 AS base
ENV TINI_VERSION v0.19.0
ENV NODE_VERSION=20.15.1
ENV YARN_VERSION=1.22.22
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    yarn=${YARN_VERSION} \
    tini=${TINI_VERSION}
....
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "yarn", "start"]
```

With ENTRYPOINT and CMD, you can call Tini to be the PID 1:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20.2 AS base
ENV TINI_VERSION v0.19.0
ENV NODE_VERSION=20.15.1
ENV YARN_VERSION=1.22.22
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    yarn=${YARN_VERSION} \
    tini=${TINI_VERSION}
....
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

If you're experiencing issues getting Tini in your Docker images, there are other ways to install it depending on the system.

### generalized containers with tini Binary

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest
ENV TINI_VERSION v0.19.0
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini /tini
RUN chmod +x /tini
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/tini
....
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Ubuntu
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y tini
....
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
```

### Alpine

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache tini
....
ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"]
```

### Python
```Dockerfile
FROM python:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache tini
....
ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"]
```

### Using Tini with Kubernetes yaml file

```yaml
containers:
- image: ourdockerfile:latest-tini-installed
  name: container-name
  command:
    ['tini', 'sh', '-c']
  args:
    ['yarn start']
```
You can either use **dumb-init** or **tini**, implementing an init process is crucial for robust, secure containerized applications.

i have been personally been using tini because i work mostly with alpine base images, and i find it simple to use with, dumb-init works same way, just my new preference.

Also if you pay closer attention to the dockerfile layer above, you will see they are not meeting the production/security readiness for creating Dockerfiles.

It's better to use multistage building and change user ownership from root to node.

Well, that's it, folks! I hope you find this piece insightful and helpful.

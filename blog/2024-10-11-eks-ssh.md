# Debugging EKS Nodes: A Complete Guide to SSH Access

Have you ever faced that dreaded moment when your EKS nodes suddenly go into a `NotReady` state? If you're managing an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, this scenario might be all too familiar. While checking cluster logs gives you some insight, sometimes you need direct access to the nodes themselves.

## The Challenge with EKS Node Access

Unlike regular EC2 instances or Kubernetes pods, accessing EKS nodes isn't as straightforward. However, there are secure and efficient methods to gain SSH access when you need to debug node-level issues.

## Method 1: Using IAM Roles with Systems Manager (Recommended)

The most secure approach involves using AWS Systems Manager (SSM) through proper IAM role configuration. Here's how to set it up:

### If You're Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

For those using Terraform or OpenTofu, you can easily attach the required IAM policy to your EKS cluster. Here's the configuration:

```hcl
module "eks" {
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version         = "20.24.0"
  cluster_name    = var.eks-name
  cluster_version = var.k8s-version

  eks_managed_node_group_defaults = {
    iam_role_additional_policies = {
      AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore"
    }
  }
  // ... other configurations
}
```

The key addition here is the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy, which enables secure node access without managing SSH keys.

### Manual Configuration Through AWS Console

If you prefer using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the IAM dashboard
2. Locate the IAM role attached to your EKS node group
3. Under "Permissions policies", add the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy
4. Save your changes

## Method 2: Using kubectl Plugins

For a more Kubernetes-native approach, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/luksa/kubectl-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#kubectl-ssh-node" target="_blank">kubectl-ssh-node plugin</a>. This method requires cluster-admin privileges but offers a simpler command-line interface.

### Quick Setup and Usage

Once the plugin is installed, accessing nodes is as simple as:

```bash
kubectl ssh node YOUR-NODE-NAME
```

## Security Benefits

Using SSM for node access offers several advantages:

- No need to manage SSH keys
- Access is controlled through IAM policies
- All connections are logged and auditable
- Secure communication through AWS's internal network

## Troubleshooting Tips

When debugging EKS nodes, remember to:

1. Check node status first: `kubectl get nodes`
2. Review system logs once connected
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Check kubelet status and logs

## Conclusion

Having secure access to your EKS nodes is crucial for effective debugging and maintenance. Whether you choose the IAM role approach or kubectl plugins, these methods provide secure and reliable access when you need it most.

Yeah, being doing the CI/CD implementations via github workflow lately and i am also trapped in the process of making commits to trigger the workflows or better still making empty commits, haha.

Well you could say why not just use Jenkins, CircleCi, Gitlab CI? i think this all boils down to what your org uses, i think there is no need to go the jenkins way, when my org uses github and github has the workflow to implement CI/CD.

So looking at the above screenshot, very sure thats how your Action page looks like too, but what if you could test the workflows you write locally before pushing it to github?

That way, you can limit the spammy look of failed builds on your Actions page.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nektos/" target="_blank">nektos</a> for building and open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act" target="_blank">Act</a>.

Act is a golang tool that allow you Run your GitHub Actions locally ðŸš€, making the feedback process really quick for your tests.

Now let's jump into how to use this

Firstly, you will need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">install docker</a>, Act depends fully on it,

Done with that? now lets install act on our enviroment, i use macOS, so i will be installing it using ```brew```, can also be used to install on linux

```mdx
brew install act
```

Check the <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act#installation-through-package-managers" target="_blank">installation guide</a> for other installation methods.

Done with the installation also? now it's time to run act, navigate into your project folder where you have your github workflow files.

## Run your github commands locally?

Now run the command ```act```, that should spin up and then display some outputs where you are asked to select the image you will like to use with act.

Choosing medium is sufficient and okay, better than micro, after the selection it will spin up the ~/.actrc file that contains the image configurations, you can always change it manually anytime.

Immediately after selecting the image size, ```act``` auto detect any workflow file in your .github/workflow folder and  then spin up a docker conatiner and runs the actions in it.

  <img src={`${useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.imgurl}/bgimg/act-image-selection.jpg`} alt="act image selection"/>
</picture>

:::note
Whenever the github actions is done, the docker conatiner gets discarded, but there is a way around that
:::

In situations where you need to get the results/feedback of your actions which are probably passed to html,json or xml files as output, you won't be able to access it because the docker container gets discarded.

But ```act``` has a subcommand to help with that, which makes your docker containers resusable.

hence you can enter the docker container to view your actions output or copy it into your local system, which ever works for you.

Here is the parameter to achieve that

```md
act --reuse
```

## Save time on running your actions locally

You can also save time running this actions, so you dont wait all day for the local option you've choosen to take your time, so if you will be running npm install or yarn in your  workflow and by chance have a node_modules folder already in your project folder

```act``` can feed on the node_modules file and speed/skip the dependencies installation process, here is the command to get that done

```md
act -b
```

Yeah, there is more, github actions secret? will your workflows with secrets run locally? Yes they will

## Passing secrets into your local github actions workflows?

Passing github workflow secrets can be done in various ways, you can enter them manually using the -s parameters

```md
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=[insert token]
```

Alternatively, you can use the --secret-file parameters too, that way you can pass more actions secret along with your workflow, just create and open"my.secrets" file in your project root folder.

```md
touch my.secrets
```

```md
open my.secrets
```

Then add your action secrets into the file in the following formats

```md
GITHUB_TOKEN=${YOUR TOKEN}
```

then run the file with the secrets-file parameter

```md
act --secret-file my.secrets
```

And thats all

Before we start, I will like to say, All these programs listed are not mandatory for you to contribute to open source.

But you can contribute to open source even if you don't get selected for these programs, you can always contribute to open source programs anytime you want.

<!--truncate-->

And also contributing to open source doesn't mean free, many companies have their open source projects, and yeah they make money from it.

See how the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/007-john-onolan-of-ghost" target="_blank">Founder of Ghost made $63,000/mo building an Open Source Publishing Platform</a>.

So there is more to Open Source than just sending PRs and submitting issues, you can also start your own open source projects.

Let’s jump in.

##  1. Reinforcement Learning Open Source Fest

So you are wondering which arch you should pick while selecting ec2 instances, well you can make decision using the below explanation

ARM64 is considered to be cost svaing and it doesnt consume much power but the yikes is that it is not a wide range compatible arch, that is some applications might not work well on it

While ARMD64 can be costly but its powerful and it supports a wide range of applications and workload.

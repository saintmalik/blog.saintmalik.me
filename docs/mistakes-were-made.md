Dont hire on the spray, discuss your idea with colleagues and kickstart with whomever buys your idea, hiring from the start can be tricky too.

if you can hire, hire, but hire those who wants to work on the product and not someone who sees it as a one time job, founding team must carry a great vibe and energy with them.

Dont wait 4 month like me to fire bad engineers, they are dream and idea killers fr, its painfull

Communicate better, be plain in your agreement and be ready to challenge anyone slowing down the startup progress.

when you get so much excuses of why there isn''t any push for the past 20 to 140 days, dont let it go beyond 15 days infact, haha

Talk them in and know the next thing.

Launch faster, launch again and again

Stop finding luxury, use everything free within your power until you cant use them again, dont be like me, i paid for mail server, it was useful though but i could have dodge that bill.

AWS Credit to the rescue, i am sure i cant even cope with cloud bills from my pocket while we are starting out fr, haha thanks to them.

Dont follow all ideas blindly, reason with your pocket and what you have on table, dont rush to do company reg when you done even have your product lauched yet.
